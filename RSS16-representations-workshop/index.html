            <p>Recent workshops have attempted to address the question of if,
            and under what conditions, should the problem of mobile robot
            navigation in an unknown environment be considered solved. While in
            certain structured environments, a case can be made that this is so,
            one particular case where there is still massive amounts of work to
            be done is in the marine context. Historical approaches to marine
            robot navigation and localization are either expensive (for example
            state of the art inertial navigation systems) or cumbersome (for
            example pre-deploying long baseline transponder networks).</p>

            <p>The major challenges in marine robotics context are: 1) The
            underwater environment is hard to sense and significantly less
            research has been undertaken to develop algorithms for processing of
            underwater sensor modalities such as sonar as compared with
            terrestrial sensors such as cameras 2) The underwater environment is
            often less structured that the terrestrial case - even if we had
            good sensors there still would not be much to use for accurate
            navigation 3) Underwater communications is challenging - recent
            results in optical underwater communications are challenging however
            to communicate for any distance larger than 150m requires the use of
            acoustics which is very low bandwidth, unreliable and high
            latency.</p>

            <p>The overall objective of the workshop is gather global experts on
            marine robotics navigation and identify areas of particular promise
            to overcome these challenges. Similar recent workshops on marine
            robotics have focused on control and autonomy but largely
            sidestepped the problem of navigation and localization.</p>

                  <b>Abstract:</b>This talk will provide a concise historical
                  review of major approaches to Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
                  navigation, with a focus on recent progress and open research
                  questions, such as navigation in polar regions and close-range
                  operations for intervention and inspection tasks. We will
                  review the major sensing modalities (acoustic beacons,
                  INS/DVL, sonar, vision) and the major inference techniques
                  (filtering and pose graph optimization). We will also survey
                  major applications including surveillance, inspection,
                  environmental monitoring, and intervention.

                      Recent Sensing and Algorithms Advances and Applying them
                      to Future Ocean Missions</i></br>
                  <b>Abstract:</b> Advances in sensing and state estimation have
                  previously transformed how we operate robots in the underwater
                  domain and enabled previously unachievable missions. For
                  example, the emergence of Doppler Velocity Logs and
                  Fiber-optic Gyroscopes in the late 1990s revolutionized
                  science, military, commercial, and archaeology applications in
                  the underwater domain. This talk builds on the spirit of these
                  prior successes by highlighting more recent advances in
                  underwater localization that emphasize both new sensing
                  modalities, such as MEMS sensors and acoustic modems, and new
                  algorithmic methods. The emphasis will be on methods that
                  improve the localization of low-cost underwater robots, extend
                  the endurance of deep-diving long-range AUVs, or enable us to
                  operate in extremely remote environs (such as the Arctic
                  Ocean).

                  <i>Challenges for underwater perception and mapping using
                      computer vision</i></br>
                  <p><b>Abstract:</b>The characteristics of the underwater
                  environment offer several challenges for using off-the-shelf
                  computer vision, mainly due to the significant attenuation and
                  scattering of visible light. Commonly, the underwater images
                  acquired by a robot suffer from lack of contrast, blurring and
                  strong moving shadows from artificial illumination. Moreover,
                  light attenuation does not allow images to be taken from a
                  large distance.</p>

                  <p>However, using the convenient image enhancement techniques,
                  and under the adequate circumstances, we can successfully
                  restore underwater images, thus enabling the possibility of
                  using them for perception and mapping. In this talk we will
                  see how to overcome the different problems associated to the
                  interaction between light and water to successfully explore
                  and map unknown areas of the seafloor.</p>
